This is the Firestorm Forum project.  We've just reached the "initial
dogfooding" phase and you can view the first deployed version at
<http://firestorm-dogfood.herokuapp.com>.

## Patrons

This project was funded by [a
Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003377429/firestorm-an-open-source-forum-in-phoenix-from-eli).

All of the patrons that made it possible are listed in [the PATRONS file](PATRONS.md).

## Development

Here are some basic steps to get Firestorm running

```shell
git clone git@github.com:dailydrip/firestorm.git
cd firestorm/
# Set the following environment variables
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=TKTK
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=TKTK
# AWS_S3_BUCKET=TKTK
# AWS_S3_REGION=TKTK
# GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=TKTK
# GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=TKTK
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=TKTK
# config postgres in config/database.yml
# start postgres
mix deps.get
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
cd assets && npm install
cd ../
mix phx.server
```

## Configuration

### S3

Attachments are stored on S3. Consequently, you will need to create an S3 bucket
to store them, as well as an API user that can write to it and list all of your
buckets, and configure the bucket for CORS.

You also need to set 4 environment variables:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX
export AWS_S3_BUCKET=XXXX
export AWS_S3_REGION=XXXX
```

#### CORS configuration

Here's an example CORS configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>http://localhost:4000</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
  </CORSRule>
  <CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>http://firestorm-dogfood.herokuapp.com</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
  </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
